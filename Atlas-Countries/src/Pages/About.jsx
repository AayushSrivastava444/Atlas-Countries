            <h2>About ATLAS COUNTRIES</h2>
            <p>AtlasCountries is a website made to help people learn about different countries in an easy and interesting way. It gives you useful information about countries from all around the world, like their flags, where they are, and what makes them special. This project was created because we believe learning about geography shouldn’t be boring or hard. Instead of using just books or maps, this website lets you explore countries in a fun and simple way. If you're a student, someone who loves to travel, or just curious about the world, AtlasCountries is perfect for you. It’s easy to use, looks nice, and helps you learn quickly. The goal is to make you feel connected to different places on Earth and enjoy discovering them. We’re also planning to add more features soon, like maps you can click on, facts about countries, and ways to explore by continent. AtlasCountries will keep getting better, and we hope you enjoy your journey around the world with us.
